Task Example: Excel Formula Generation

Prompt Used:
"Add formulas to calculate:
- Average order value  
- % contribution of each country to total sales  
- Highlight top 5 countries by revenue using conditional formatting  
- Create a chart to visualize monthly revenue trend"

AI Response:

Great! You’ve built a clean Pivot Table showing Total Sales by Country and Month. Now let’s complete the remaining steps:

1. Average Order Value
This metric = Total Revenue ÷ Total Number of Orders

In Excel:
Assuming:
- Your data (not the pivot) has a column InvoiceNo (unique per order),
- And TotalSales is already calculated,

You can use:

=SUM(TotalSalesColumn)/COUNTA(UNIQUE(InvoiceNoColumn))

Example:
=SUM(H2:H1000)/COUNTA(UNIQUE(A2:A1000))

2. % Contribution of Each Country to Total Sales
In a new column (next to Grand Total):

=[@Grand Total] / GrandTotalValue

Or:

=N2/$N$42

Format the column as Percentage.

3. Highlight Top 5 Countries by Revenue
Steps:
- Select the “Grand Total” column.
- Go to Home > Conditional Formatting > Top 10 Items…
- Change 10 to 5, choose a highlight fill color.

4. Chart for Monthly Revenue Trend
Steps:
- Select the row showing Grand Totals per month.
- Go to Insert > Line or Column Chart.
- Title it “Monthly Revenue Trend”.

Reflection:

What did the AI do well?
The AI gave clear, structured, and accurate Excel steps with formulas and navigation menus tailored for pivot-based data. It even included formatting and visualization tips.

What did I have to modify or improve?
I had to manually adapt some formulas to fit my actual column ranges, and ensure the pivot fields aligned with the data structure. I also renamed the columns in my sheet to match what the AI expected.
